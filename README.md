# StrucID
# Identifiability analysis from parametric output sensitivities

This is the StrucID package for analysing identifiability, observability, and reachability of nonlinear state-space models with a GUI interface that allows selection of parameters/inputs/outputs.

[This](https://github.com/jdstigter/StrucID/blob/main/MyAppInstaller_web.exe) file contains a deployable executable that runs WITHOUT Matlab software.

[This](https://github.com/jdstigter/StrucID/blob/main/StrucIDAppMatlab2021b_3_8.mlapp) and [this](https://github.com/jdstigter/StrucID/blob/main/StrucIDAppMatlab2024b_3_8.mlapp) file contain the APP version of the package for Matlab R2021b and R2024b, respectively.

Go the the folder with [papers](https://github.com/jdstigter/StrucID/tree/main/Papers%20on%20the%20Method%20Behind%20StrucID) to find some background material on the methodology that underpins StrucID.

Finally, the .txt files are input files with examples to show you how your model can be entered and analysed with StrucID. Good luck!
